# Zenote

hi :3

***Zenote*** is a stripped down note taking program that provides a feeling of zen and tranquility to anyone who uses it. There are to unnecessary toolbars, font sizes, graphs, or other visual eyesores that may prevent or distract you from taking notes. Everything you need to know can be found in one row. Need to change fonts? Look to the row. Need to render an equation? Look to the row. Need help studying or memorizing your notes???? **LOOK TO THE ROW!!**

***Zenote*** is currently in development, but some features to be added are:
- Vim Motions
- Easy Equation render
- Simple UI design
- Formatting configuration
- Custom .zn files that can only be read by ***Zenote***
- Table making
- Saving to PDF
- think of more things to add later idk lol
